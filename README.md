I'm Mariana, a software developer currently based in London with a background in customer success and user research. 

ðŸ”­ At the moment I'm working on ... applying my skills to things that bring me joy! Like building an app to help me bake sourdough! I'm lucky enough to be in a career where I also _love_ what I do and can use my professional development to further my personal development. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... how to make Next.js and styled-components cooperate ðŸ™ƒ Otherwise, I'm enjoying playing around with data and D3

âœ¨ Obsessed with ... tracking my health stats enough to finally be able to get a good night's sleep ðŸ’¤ There's an app in there somewhere (...and I'm working on it!)
